Copyright - Plagiarism

You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks below yourself to meet with the above learning objectives.

You will not be able to meet the objectives of this or any following project by copying and pasting someone else’s work.

You are not allowed to publish any content of this project.

Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.

Requirements

Python Scripts

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs

All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)

All your files should end with a new line

The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3

A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory

Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)

All your files must be executable

The length of your files will be tested using wc

C Scripts

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs

All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89

All your files should end with a new line

Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl

You are not allowed to use global variables

No more than 5 functions per file

In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples

The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called lists.h

Don’t forget to push your header file

All your header files should be include guarded

More Info

Note: you do not need to understand lists yet.

Tasks

0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing

mandatory

Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)

This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable number is positive or negative.



You can find the source code here

The variable number will store a different value every time you will run this program

You don’t have to understand what import, random. randint do. Please do not touch this code

The output of the program should be:

The number, followed by

if the number is greater than 0: is positive

if the number is 0: is zero

if the number is less than 0: is negative

followed by a new line
